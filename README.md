## Word Frequency Analyzer

A C-based project designed to analyze textual datasets for frequency patterns. This implementation combines the efficiency of a **Hash Table** for data storage and lookup with the priority management of a **Min Heap** to identify the most frequently occurring words.

####Features
1. **Print Dataset Head:** Displays the first 10 words of the dataset.
2. **Identify Most Frequent Words:** Extracts the n most frequently occurring words from the dataset.
3. **Word Lookup:** Searches for a specific word in the dataset and returns its frequency.

####How to Run the Project
- Clone the repo
- `make` build program
- `make hash_heap` run program
- `make test_runner` run test
- `make clean` clean generated files
